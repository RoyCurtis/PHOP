# To-Do
A loose list of ideas planned for PHOP/VWAS, both short-term and long-term

## Short term
* Investigate asset serve delay issues

## Long term
* **Move away from PHP** - [For obvious reasons](me.veekun
.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/). However, I still would like to port
 PHOP to ReactPHP first.
* **World-centric and other abstractions** - PHOP should be able to serve multiple
worlds and reuse abstract concepts such as remote storage points
* **Upload interface** - Allow for HTML5 drag-and-drop of a loose collection of assets
to upload to the server, that allows for:
** Sandboxing and metadata tagging of public user uploads
** Auto-sorting based on extension and even content
** Alerts based on common issues such as missing textures and incompatiable formats
** Auto-passwording (or de-passwording)
* **Admin-panel** - Instead of relying on a .JSON or .PHP file that the user needs to
edit, a friendly web-based panel for modifying options and organizing assets
* **Thumbnail view for assets** - Would allow for quick lookups of textures
